                <p>Based on the process of web development, a web developer is a programmer that creates web-based
                    applications to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and
                    functions that the dev is responsible to build through his programming skills.Web development
                    consists of 2 major sections.1. FrontEnd Web Developer (it is responsible for building and designing
                    layouts, features, and appearance of a website.) 2. BackEnd Web Developer(it is responsible for
                    building the driving system of a website.)</p>

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>Mission is the core purpose of an organization or a company. It is a summary of the aims and core
                    values. A mission clearly tells what you as an organization does for customers. A mission is
                    comprehensive but also very specific to set you apart from other organizations.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>A vision is the bigger picture. Your life's vision defines who you want to be, what you want to be
                    known for and the set of experiences and accomplishments you aim for. Your vision helps define the
                    goals by giving you a framework to evaluate those goals.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Life goals are all the things you want to accomplish in your life. Often your life goals are very
                    meaningful to you and can make a lasting impact on your life. They can be large and challenging
                    goals, or they can be smaller and more personal. It all depends on what you want to achieve.</p>
